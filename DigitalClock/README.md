# Scope
    A digital clock or watch in which the hours, minutes, and sometimes seconds are indicated by digits, 
    as opposed to an analog clock, where the time is indicated by the positions of rotating hands. It also tells you the date.
    Both Time and Date are real-time.
    
        Basic knowledge application of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    
# Methodology
    I first created the outline of the project which is the HTML.
    After that I design it using CSS. Like the color and alignment.
    Then I create objects in JavaScript to get the hour, minutes, and seconds. I also include the Date.
    
# Results
    If you download the folder and run the index.html.
    It will open in your default browser(I recommend Google Chrome).
    Then it will show you the current time (including seconds) and date of today.
    
# Learnings
    I learned from this project that you need to finish the HTML first before the CSS. 
    By doing the CSS first it will creat conflict when you made the HTML and connect both.
    This was the first time I tried JavaScript. 
    It was very exciting feeling when you try a new language and it runs well.
