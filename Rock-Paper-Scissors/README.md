# Scope
    The objective of this project is to create the classic game rock-paper-scissors.
    So you can play it in your browser.
    First to win 5 rounds win the game.
    
    
# Methodology
    I first created the outline of the project which is the HTML.
    After that I design it using CSS. Like the color and alignment.
    It also my first time using BOOTSTRAP.
    Then made the logic of the game icluding some error tappings.
    
    
# Results
    If you download the folder and run the index.html.
    It will open in your default browser(I recommend Google Chrome).
    Choose between rock, paper, and scissors.
    First to win 5 rounds win.
    
# Learnings
    I learned in this project is that you need to list the all errors possible.
    Before making the JavaScript or it will quite confusing if you add it one by one.
    Making this game is one of the hardest I face during the college days.
    Contradicting to that, it was fun and exciting making this game.
