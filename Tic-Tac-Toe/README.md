# Scope
    The objective of this project is to create the famous game Tic-Tac-Toe.
    Allow multiplayer.
    When winner, winners cells highlights.
    Include button to reset the game at any time even during playtime.
    
# Methodology
    I first created the outline of the project which is the HTML.
    After that I design it using CSS. Like the color and alignment.
    Then I created JavaScript search the possible errors during the game.
    
# Results
    If you download the folder and run the index.html.
    It will open in your default browser(I recommend Google Chrome).
    You can play with your friends.
    
# Learnings
    This project made me realize that JavaScript can be quite confusing.
    Especially recreating the logic of the game to JavaScript.
    I also learned that now all things can be done alone.
    And its not to be ashamed of if you ask help of others.
    Even though the thing you ask help of can be easy for them.
