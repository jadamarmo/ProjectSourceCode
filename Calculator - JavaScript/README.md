# Scope
    The objective of this project is to create a working calculator.
    It will not stop accepting input until the user press the 'equal'. 
    The user can clear the field by clicking the clear button.
    
# Methodology
    I first created the outline of the project which is the HTML.
    After that I design it using CSS. Like the color and alignment.
    Then I apply the math logic of basic arithmetic.
    Then I apply some error tappings as well.
    
# Results
    If you download the folder and run the index.html.
    It will open in your default browser(I recommend Google Chrome).
    Then you can now use a working calculator with error tappings.
    
# Learnings
    I learned from this project is that even the basic knowledge of math is important.
    The knowledge and logic of math can be applied to programming.
    It also expanded my knowledge in JavaScript.
